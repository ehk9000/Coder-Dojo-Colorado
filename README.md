## CoderDojo Colorado 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/turing-coderdojo/coderdojo-fe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/turing-coderdojo/coderdojo-fe)

## Description
CoderDojo is a global volunteer-led charity providing free programming workshops for young people between 7 and 17. It is a grassroots collection of independently run Dojos teaching a variety of STEM classes. This app provides a way for the independently run Dojos in Colorado to keep track of their student's attendance and for the leaders of the Dojos to create and edit events for their classes. The platform hosts multiple venues, and registering on the app will give parents/students the ability to log their attendance at meetings at any venue. This app was created as our capstone project at Turing School of Software and Design. It is a collaboration between three Frontend Engineers and one Backend Engineer.

## Deployment
The site is deployed at https://coderdojo-colorado.herokuapp.com/

The backend of our site can be found at https://github.com/turing-coderdojo/coderdojo-BE
